# Introduction : 
This is package enables a developer to use Foreground service within its React native app. The library works only with android since IOS doesn't support foreground service.

### Foreground service
A **foreground service** performs some operation that is noticeable to the user. For example, an audio app would use a **foreground service** to play an audio track. **Foreground services** must display a Notification. **Foreground services** continue running even when the user isn't interacting with the app. [Read More](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwia7qDp2MjrAhUS5uAKHb3OCgAQFjADegQICxAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fguide%2Fcomponents%2Fservices&usg=AOvVaw09DFr2GRCWtnLbq_m8UTRv)
  
  In short, a Foreground service is a service that runs even when you don't have your app running on recent apps. A foreground service is a notification that lets you run a background task.

Before anything you need to set up foreground service and do the manual linking, here is the link to the [Installation Docs]([https://github.com/Raja0sama/-supersami-react-native-foreground-service/blob/master/Installation.md#installation](https://github.com/Raja0sama/-supersami-react-native-foreground-service/blob/master/Installation.md#installation))


[Working Example](https://github.com/Raja0sama/ForegroundSerivceExample.git)

# Basic Usage:

#### 1
The very first step will be to register the foreground service in your root index.js file.
```
import  ReactNativeForegroundService  from  '@supersami/react-native-foreground-service';
// This will register your headless task.
ReactNativeForegroundService.register();
```
#### Usage : 
```
const App = () => {
  const onStart = () => {
    // Checking if the task i am going to create already exist and running, which means that the foreground is also running.
    if (ReactNativeForegroundService.is_task_running('taskid')) return;
    // Creating a task.
    ReactNativeForegroundService.add_task(
      () => console.log('I am Being Tested'),
      {
        delay: 100,
        onLoop: true,
        taskId: 'taskid',
        onError: (e) => console.log(`Error logging:`, e),
      },
    );
    // starting  foreground service.
    return ReactNativeForegroundService.start({
      id: 144,
      title: 'Foreground Service',
      message: 'you are online!',
    });
  };

  const onStop = () => {
    // Make always sure to remove the task before stoping the service. and instead of re-adding the task you can always update the task.
    if (ReactNativeForegroundService.is_task_running('taskid')) {
      ReactNativeForegroundService.remove_task('taskid');
    }
    // Stoping Foreground service.
    return ReactNativeForegroundService.stop();
  };
  return (
    <>
      <StatusBar barStyle="dark-content" />
      <SafeAreaView
        style={{flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center'}}>
        <Text>An Example for React Native Foreground Service. </Text>
        <Button title={'Start'} onPress={onStart} />
        <Button title={'Stop'} onPress={onStop} />
      </SafeAreaView>
    </>
  );
};
```
